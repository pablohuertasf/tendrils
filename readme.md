# Tendrils

See `Makefile` and `package.json` for supported versions of tools, main setup, and running the project:
- Install the supported version of `node` (e.g: if you manage node versions with `n`, run `n 7.2.0` in a command-line window).
- Run `make setup` to install everything.
- Run `make watch` to watch and build files.
- Run `make server` in a separate command-line window to see it in your browser (on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`).
- Run `make dist` when ready to build the files to export to your website.

Edit `src/demo.main.js` to see changes.

Use the files in `build/` to integrate the project into your website.
